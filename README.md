# Note Taker

## Description

Create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Installing

Run npm install to install all dependencies. To use the application locally, run node server.js in your CLI, and then open http://localhost:8080 in your preferred browswer. The Note Taker app is available at https://glacial-beach-92039.herokuapp.com/ for you to use as well.

## Learning Points

This app was a practice in writing the backend code only and then integrating it with provided front end code (index.html, notes.html, and custom jQuery)
Practice setting up an Express server and in particular learning the importance of using the express.static() function to ensure proper delivery of local js/css files used by html files being delivered via .sendFile();
